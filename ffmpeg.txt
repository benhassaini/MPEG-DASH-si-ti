1. Multi-resolution and Multi-bitrate Transcoding

ffmpeg -i input_video.mp4 -s <resolution> -c:v libx264 -b:v <bitrate> -g <GOP> -an output_video.mp4


A reference Full-HD video (Big Buck Bunny / Sintel) is transcoded into several spatial resolutions and bitrates to generate multiple representations.

2. Encoder Configuration for Objective Metrics (PSNR)

ffmpeg -i input_video.mp4 -c:v libx264 -tune psnr output_video.mp4


Psychovisual optimizations are disabled to ensure consistent objective quality measurements.

3. Objective Quality Evaluation (VMAF / SSIM / PSNR)

ffmpeg -i distorted.mp4 -i reference.mp4 -lavfi libvmaf=ssim=1 -f null -


Each encoded representation is compared to the reference sequence to compute objective quality metrics.

4. Scene Change Detection

ffmpeg -i input_video.mp4 -filter:v "select='gt(scene,THRESHOLD)'" -f null -


Scene boundaries are detected to enable content-aware analysis and segmentation.

5. GOP and Keyframe Alignment

ffmpeg -i input_video.mp4 -g <GOP> -keyint_min <GOP> -sc_threshold 0 output_keyframe.mp4


Keyframes are aligned across representations to ensure segment synchronization for adaptive streaming.

6. Video Segmentation (Fixed Duration)

MP4Box -split <segment_duration> -out output_segments input_video.mp4


Encoded videos are segmented into fixed-duration chunks (e.g., 5 seconds).

7. Segment Concatenation

ffmpeg -f concat -safe 0 -i file_list.txt -c copy merged.mp4


Segments are concatenated when reconstructing sequences for analysis or subjective evaluation.

8. MPEG-DASH Packaging

MP4Box -dash <segment_duration> -rap -frag-rap -out manifest.mpd input_video.mp4


Segments and MPD manifests compliant with MPEG-DASH are generated.

9. Spatial and Temporal Information Extraction (SI/TI)
    
siti-tools input_video.mp4 > output.json


Spatial (SI) and temporal (TI) complexity indicators are computed for content characterization.
